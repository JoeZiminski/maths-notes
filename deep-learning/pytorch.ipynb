    "# Introduction to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a very flexible model through which to learn complex, high dimensional functions. First, we will apply the model in Pytorch, and then implement it by hand, using multivariable calculus to derive the parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will apply a neural network to an image classification problem. We have a dataset containing images clothes, with each image having a label describing the item of clothing in the image. Each $28 \\times 28$-pixel image is represented as a length $784$ vector $\\mathbf{x}$. We use bold font to indicate a vector. There are 10 possible items of clothing (e.g. t-shirt, hat) in our dataset, so $y$ is an integer in the range $[0, 10]$. Together, our sample space is pairings of images and labels, $(\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) \\sim (\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y})$ (i.e. a single image, label pair index by $i$ can be drawn from the sample space of all pairs of images and labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to learn the conditional distribution $p(y| \\mathbf{x})$ i.e. what is the probability of the label $y$ given an image, $\\mathbf{x}$. For example, what is the probability this is an image $\\mathbf{x}$ is of a t-shirt? In this case, we want to learn a function $f(\\mathbf{x}) : \\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{y}$. It will take a vector of length $784$ and output a vector of length $10$, with each element of the output vector assigning some weight related to the probability of image $\\mathbf{x}$ being a particular label $y$. These unnormalised weights output by the model are called 'logits'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nn-image-1.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will first follow the [Pytorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html) 'Getting Started' page to train a simple model for this classification task. Then, we will get a deeper grip on how these models work by implementing the model ourselves in Numpy, which requires calculating the derivatives required for model training ourselves.\n",
