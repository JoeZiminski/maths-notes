Note all the different types of functions:

(input-output)

scalar-scalar (usual derivative)

vector-scalar

scalar-vector (ignore, not typical)

vector-vector

matrix-vector

vector-matrix (ignore, not typical)

and their dericatives (scalar derivative, jacobian, w.r.t. a matrix, etc)

also the total derivative case:

df(x(t), y(t))/ dt
