    "# Argand Diagrams and Polar Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Argand diagrams are like normal graphs but the y-axis is imaginary. Important for interpreting complex numbers geometrically (e.g.modulus-argument form, roots of unity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers can be interpreted as vectors on the Argand diagram. Complex-magnitude form is the polar coordinate system. Complex exponential form is the phasor (vector) interpretation.\n",

    "## Loci\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to using 2-d functions to draw shapes in the real domain (e.g. $r^2 = x^2 + y^2$ is a circle), we can use complex numbers to represent a **locus of points**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation-wise this is important, previously we were representing a single point, now we represent locus of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distance between points**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"./arg-diagrams-polar/loci_distance.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "$|z_1 - z_2| = \\textnormal{distance}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So like vectors, the magnitude of the difference between the vectors is the distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circle**\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",

    "$|z - z_1| = r$ is a circle with radius r.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $z_1 = a + bi$ where a and b represent the circle center..\n",

    "$|z - z_1| = |z - z_2|$. This makes intuitive sense, the line bisector is equal distance between $z_1$ and $z_2$.\n",

    "$\\arg(z - z_1) = \\theta$ is a half line from, but not including $z_1$. This can be interpreted as all (increasing) points at a fixed angle from the real line to $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex number loci can be used to represent regions on the Argand diagram. This can be done by using inequality, rather than equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the circle $|z - z_1| \\leq r$ contains all points within the circle and the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polar Coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the same as modulus-argument form of complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, a point is represented as the magnitude and angle of a vector, $(r, \\theta)$.\n",

    "Note that sin is mapped to the imaginary axis for complex numbers because $r\\sin(\\theta) = y = i$\n",

    "### Area enclosed by a polar curve\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very nice, can approach as pretty much standard integration, just don't forget the square and keep notes on the bounds.\n",
